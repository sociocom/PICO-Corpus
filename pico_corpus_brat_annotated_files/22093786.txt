[Clinical comparative study of neoadjuvant chemotherapy outcome in locally advanced breast cancer: docetaxel versus paclitaxel plus pirarubicin hydrochloride and cyclophosphamide]. To compare the efficacy and toxicity of neoadjuvant chemotherapy of docetaxel with paclitaxel plus pirarubicin hydrochloride (THP) and cyclophosphamide (CTX) in locally advanced breast cancer (LABC). A total of 97 LABC cases were randomly divided into 2 groups: docetaxel group (n = 49, taxotere plus THP & CTX) and paclitaxel group (n = 48, paclitaxel plus THP & CTX). Neoadjuvant chemotherapy had four cycles of 21 days each. The clinical and pathological complete remission rates of docetaxel group was 28.6% and 26.5% respectively. They were significantly higher than those of paclitaxel group (10.4% and 8.3%). Furthermore the pathological negative rate of regional lymph node in docetaxel group was also significantly higher than that of paclitaxel group (40.6% vs. 12.9%). However, grade III-IV blood system toxic reaction was found in 71.4% cases, grade II-IV liver dysfunction in 53.1% cases and edema in 24.5% cases among docetaxel group. They were higher than those among paclitaxel group (46.9%, 27.1% & 4.2%). Compared with paclitaxel, the combined regimen of docetaxel plus THP and CTX offers better outcomes for locally advanced breast cancer.
